# 3rd-term-assignment-1
The assignment looks a littke confusing but  basically what we are asked is applying some functions on an AVL tree.

There are 5 functions we are asked o implement:
1) Adding a new node
2) removing an existing node
3) Finding the common parent of 2 nodes with lowest height.
4) Finding the maximum number of indepedent members (independent members are the members that does not have direct parent-child relationship with each other)
5) Finding all the nodes that have same height with a given node
